# to isolate the line we want to comment out.
# It's designed to handle variations in the scene name.
find_pattern = re.compile(
    # Part 1: Capture everything from "if (isAndroid)" up to the line we want to change.
    # The `.*?` is a non-greedy match for any characters, including newlines.
    r"(if \(isAndroid\) \{.*?//window\.location\.href = intent;\s*\n)"
    
    # Part 2: Capture the indentation (whitespace) of the target line.
    r"(\s*)"
    
    # Part 3: Capture the content of the target line, allowing any scene name.
    r"(window\.location\.href = 'xr\.html\?scene=.*?&xr=ar';)"
    
    # Part 4: Capture the rest of the code block until its final closing brace.
    r"(.*?\s*\})",
    
    # Use re.DOTALL to make '.' match newline characters.
    flags=re.DOTALL

# The replacement string uses backreferences (\1, \2, etc.) to rebuild the block.
# We insert "//" before the original line's content (\3) to comment it out.
